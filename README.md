MVP:
- Trefle API to get information on different plants and information, display information about plant.     
- Have view of garden and all the plants inside. 
- Add plants from API to garden. 
- See details of plant in garden in separte view where user can input notes
- Add notifications under garden plant detail 

Later Version Ideas:
- User to add plant throught their own input
- Entry's become their own View
- Notes become more than just a TextEditor
- suggested plants on the plantAPIView
